The losp language



The losp language is a super simple assemly like language that
aims to help people understand the fundamentals of programming.
It aims to do this by providing a simple as possible interface
to program with.
Losp only has a few instructions to work with, but they are
more than enough to build simple computer programs with.
Losp is a super simple interpreted language that executes
straight of an AST. It does not compile to anything.


The following instructions are available in losp:

DEF A<B,...>:
    defines a function

END
    declares the end of a function

MEM
    defines a variable in memory

A[B,...]
    calls a function

ANB<A,B>
    inbuilt function for checking if A != B

AIB<A,B>
    inbuilt function checking if A == B

DSP
    prints a value to the screen
