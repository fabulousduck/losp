assignment:

Just-in-time compilation tends to be the fastest way to implement a dynamically-typed language, but not all of them use it. What reasons are there to not JIT?

They do less optimalisation as they need to be fast. So in being fast they leave
a lot of the optimalisation that a normal compiler can do because it does not
have the time for it as it needs to do everything on the fly not to keep the
user waiting.
