Assignment:


Pick an open source implementation of a language you like. Download the source code and poke around in it. Try to find the code that implements the scanner and parser. Are they hand-written, or generated using tools like Lex and Yacc? (.l or .y files usually imply the latter.)


Result:

    Golang has an open source compiler that compiles to a lot of different
    architectures.
    Its scanner / lexer is thuis also open source.
    This scanner is written by hand, in Go no less. It does a lot of things
    because it has to be reliable, but it comes down to the same principles as
    explained in the book. It reads the source code string character by
    character and builds them up into words we understand. "Tokens" if you will.
